## What AI Analyzes

### 1. 💡 Recommendations Tab
Based on **your actual spending**, AI recommends:

**Example Analysis:**
```
If you spend most on Food (₹5000):
→ "You spend most on food (₹5000). Try reducing by 15% to save ₹750."

If you spend during peak hours (12pm, 6pm, 8pm):
→ "Your peak hours are 12:00, 18:00, 20:00. Be careful during these times!"

If your average is ₹600 per transaction:
→ "Your average is ₹600. Set safe limit at ₹480 to build savings."
```

Detailed breakdown of **your spending patterns**:
- **Total Transactions**: Count of expenses YOU added
- **Total Spending**: Sum of ALL YOUR expenses
- **Average per Transaction**: Your specific average
- **Category Breakdown**: How YOU spend across categories
- **Peak Hours**: When YOU spend the most

### 3. 🚨 Anomalies Tab
Detects **unusual transactions in YOUR data**:
```
Example:
If your average is ₹500 but you spent ₹3000:
→ "Detected unusual spending of ₹3000 in shopping"
```

### 4. 🔮 Predictions Tab
Forecasts **your future spending** based on patterns:
```
Based on your last 30 days:
If you spend ₹15,000 total:
